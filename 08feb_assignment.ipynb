    "\"Example:- of abstraction and encapsulation in OOP is a simple car\". The car can be considered as an abstract class, and various types of cars, such as sedan, SUV, truck, etc., can be considered as its concrete implementations. The abstract class \"car\" can have properties like number of wheels, number of doors, and a method to start the engine. The concrete implementations, such as sedan or SUV, can have specific details like number of seats and fuel capacity, but the user of the car class only needs to know that it has wheels, doors, and an engine that can be started, which is the abstract information. The user doesn't need to know the internal details of how the engine starts, as that is encapsulated within the class.\n"

An abstract class is a class that contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared but not defined in the class.

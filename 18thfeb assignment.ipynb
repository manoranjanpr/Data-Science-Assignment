    "--> APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the weather bureau's software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.\n",

    "Google Maps is using Uber’s API to request information by sending a HTTP request function with the start and end points of the ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber’s API then sends information back such as how many cars are available, where are they currently located, and the costs for the various ride options.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information is then processed by Google Maps and is available to the user directly linking them the the Uber app if it is previously downloaded."

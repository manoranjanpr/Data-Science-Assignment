    "\n",
    "Improved performance: One of the main advantages of multithreading is improved performance. By allowing multiple threads of execution to run concurrently, a program can perform multiple tasks at the same time, potentially improving the overall performance of the application.\n",
    "Efficient use of system resources: Multithreading can also help to make more efficient use of system resources, such as CPU time and memory. By running multiple threads in parallel, a program can use these resources more effectively and avoid wasting time waiting for I/O or other blocking operations to complete.\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can also help to improve the responsiveness of an application. By running long-running tasks in a separate thread, the main thread can remain responsive to user input and other events, providing a better user experience.\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading can also add complexity to a program. Handling shared resources, such as variables or files, between threads can be challenging and can lead to issues like deadlocks, race conditions, or synchronization problems.\n",
    "Increased memory usage: Multithreading can also increase the memory usage of a program, since each thread requires its own stack and other data structures. This can become a problem if a program creates too many threads or if memory usage is already high.\n",
    "Debugging: Debugging a multithreaded program can be more difficult than debugging a single-threaded program, as issues can be harder to reproduce and diagnose."

    "\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource that they need in order to proceed. This can result in a situation where no thread can make progress, and the program effectively freezes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the timing or order of events in different threads. This can lead to unpredictable or incorrect behavior, as different threads may access or modify shared resources in an unexpected order.\n",
